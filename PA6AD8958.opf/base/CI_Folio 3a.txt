I had heard about the glory, fame,and splendour of the body of the Victorious One,but you are
even more sublime in person,like an image in gold.Your body is graceful and beautiful.Because
of your exalted, golden formyou shine among the monkslike the moon among the stars.Never
before have I seen the crown of the head of the greatest among men,but now I see it rising
up like Mount Meru,like the parasol of the gods,a sign that you have attained the highest
degree of transformation.I see the hair on your head, delicate and supple,shining like
a dark sapphire.Its soft curls twist to the rightJust like the neck of a peacock.The best
of speakers has a smooth forehead,your eyebrows shaped like rainbows.Between your eyebrows
shines a perfect curl of hairblazing like the king of stars.Your eyes are exquisite, and
delight all who look upon them.They are beautiful, beloved by those who gaze upon them.Merely
observing is not enough for me,I salute the protector with immaculate eyes.The nose
of the best of menis as magnificent as a golden horn,his lips coral-red like the fruit of
the ivy gourd,exceedingly pure like a precious jewel.Your shining teeth are perfectly white,like
lotus-root, cow’s milk, or a crane.Firm, whole, well set, supremely pure,your teeth
are an ornament to joyous discipline.The Victorious One's teeth are well-spaced,the canine
teeth shining spotlessly,like the king of the geese, flying first in formation,whiter than
white, and completely pure.Like a pure red lotus, the color of copper,red like the rising
sun, the color of a pure jewel,the Sugata’s tongue is delicate and smooth,and so long
and broad that it can cover his face.I have truly never seen or heard of anythingin the brahma-world,
or in any human or divine realm,like the exquisite ears of Gautama.He has the
jaws and the courage of a lion.By the power of the blissful one, I see his neck,his pure and
resplendent throat, extracting the subtle essence of flavors,straight, not crooked, and
centrally positioned.His sense of taste is unrivalled, like that of the god of gods and men.You
are broad-chested, and your shoulder blades are round.Your seven supreme limbs are
famed throughout the world.Blazing with the highest glory, the archetypal king,you are like
the sun rising over the peak of the mountain.There are protrubrances on the soles of both
of your feet,on both of your hands, and on both shoulders,and one protrubrance on the back
of your neck.The fullness of your beauty is pure and radiant.The arms of the Blessed One
Gautama hang down,like the trunk of the lord of elephants.With both of your hands, you are
ableto touch your knees without bending down.His mighty chest is like that of a lion.Broad,
like the trunk of a banyan tree,his sturdy body is as strong and firm as that of Nārāyāṇa,With
the strength that comes from forbearance.The hairs on his upper body curl to the
right.They grow separately, and are very soft.They are unaffected by dust and smoke,just
like lotuses in muddy water.Your male organ is said to be retracted in its sheathlike that
of an excellent, well-trained horse.Your well-rounded thighs are like the cores of bamboo.Your
calves are well-formed, with the correct proportions.You have flat insteps and broad
heels.Your hands and feet are finely webbed.Your long, smooth fingers and toes number twenty,with
copper colored nails, like flowers.The symbol of the supreme thousand-spoked wheelshines
from the soles of your feet.You do not put your feet down hard when you walk on the
road. 1You stride lightly on the earth.You tread softly, lifting your feet four inches above
groundas you walk, O best of men!Jeweled lotuses spring forthwherever you set your feet.
How extraordinary!You advance unopposed, undaunted, repelling your enemies,like an elephant,
like a tiger, like the lord of the gods.You walk like nothing less than a hero.Imperturbable,
you stride elegantly.Superhuman beings shower you, lord, with divine flowers.In
the sky, they venerate youwith the sounds of singing.Such magical displays are truly wondrous.Your
beauty surpasses that of Vaiśramaṇa,your splendor is like that of a hundred suns.In
the world of brahmans, of gods and men,you have no equal. Truly, how could anyone be superior?Having
now seen this incredible miracle,I am filled with curiosity.What are the superior
qualities you have seen,lord of men, that made you renounce ordinary life?The Blessed
One then said this to the merchant and householder Bhadrapāla:“Alas! One who is involved
with the world is tormented by the ten afflictions.What are these ten afflictions?They are
the affliction of birth,

the affliction of old age,

the affliction of disease,

the affliction of death,

the affliction of sorrow,

the affliction of lamentation,

the affliction of suffering,

the affliction of depression,

the affliction of grief,

and the affliction of cyclic existence.

Householder, when I saw that one who is involved with the world is tormented by these ten afflictions,
I decided to attain unsurpassed perfect awakening, and with that conviction I left
ordinary household life behind and became a renunciant.”
