the taint of misunderstanding,

the taint of inattentiveness,

the taint of doubt,

the taint of mistrust,

and the taint of disrespect.

Householder, when I saw that one who is involved with the world is defiled by these ten vices,
I decided to attain undefiled unsurpassed perfect awakening.

With that conviction, I left ordinary household life behind and became a renunciant.”

To emphasize that this is the way things are, he said the following:

No matter how much those in this worldare tortured by the ten kinds of corruption,they still
take joy in the various combinations of corruptions,and never grow tired of them.

All immature common people,defiled by the taint of envy,say “I will assume the training”,but
are faulty in conduct and lack discipline.

Fools turn their back on patience,they are lazy and lack vigor.Their minds are fickle,and they
are deluded by misunderstanding.

They lack reverence for parents,for elders, and for teachers,and even when they see the light
of the world,the buddhas, the weak-minded still doubt.

They reject the authentic teaching,the profound utterances of the Victorious One.Tied down by
dull skandhasthey have no admiration for the noble assembly.

Having seen this corruption,I took no joy in anything conditionedand decided to attain cessation,the
unconditioned, the uncorrupted.
