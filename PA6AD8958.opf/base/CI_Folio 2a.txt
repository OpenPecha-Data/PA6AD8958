The householder Bhadrapāla heard that the mendicant Gautama, who had renounced the Śākya clan
and become an ascetic, was travelling in Magadha together with a great community of mendicants,
1,250 strong, that he had arrived at the great city of Rājagṛha, and that he was now
staying on Vulture's Peak, near the city, and that he was being greeted with elegant and
generous words of praise:"Such indeed is the Blessed One: He has reached truth, he is worthy
of offerings, a fully accomplished Buddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, he has reached
bliss, he is a knower of the world, an unsurpassable guide for those who wish to train,
a teacher of gods and men, awakened, and blessed.He teaches the true Dharma, he reveals
the holy life, excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end,
accurate in meaning and well expressed, simple, complete, genuine and pure."

He thought to himself: "Now I should really go to see the ascetic Gautama.It is wonderful to
have the opportunity to see those who have reached truth and are worthy of offerings, who
are fully accomplished buddhas."So it was that the merchant and householder Bhadrapāla left
the great city of Rājagṛha in the company of 500 householders in order to see the Blessed
One.

of monks into the great city of Rājagṛha to collect alms. He conducted himself with
grace, going from place to place with eyes downcast in a graceful manner, moving his limbs
gracefully, and bearing his robes and bowl with exceeding grace.The merchant and householder
Bhadrapāla, together with the 500 other householders, saw the Blessed One in the distance,
approaching them in a graceful and pleasant manner, with his senses composed and his
mind at ease, supremely disciplined and tranquil.His senses subdued, with the dignity of
an elephant,he was clear and shining like a lake of pure water.He was honored by a great
many gods, honored by a great many yakṣas, honored by a great many men.His body was golden,
with the thirty-two marks of a great being, and adorned with the eighty secondary characteristics.A
great rain of flowers, a great flood of flowers, rained down upon him, and so
he walked among a thousand billion lotus petals made of the seven kinds of jewels.When they
saw him approaching in the distance with this display of many hundreds of thousands of forms
of pure conduct, they were filled with faith in the Blessed One.Their minds filled with
faith, they approached the Blessed One, venerated him by placing their heads at his feet,and
sat down at one side.Then the householder Bhadrapāla, accompanied by the other 500 householders,
spoke to the Blessed One:
