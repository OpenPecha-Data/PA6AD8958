What, then, is the bodhisatva’s perfection of meditation, by which bodhisatvas, great beings
strive to practice the way of the bodhisatva?

Śāriputra, the bodhisatva has left desires behind. He has left evil, unwholesome qualities behind,
and attains and abides in the first dhyāna, the state of joy and happiness that is
born from aloofness, and that includes conceptualization and deliberation.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, having stilled conceptualization and deliberation, with a mind
which has calmed itself and become focused, attains and abides in the second dhyāna, the
state of joy and happiness that is born from concentration, and that is without conceptualization
or deliberation.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva abides in equanimity because he is not attached to joy, and
with mindfulness and thoughtfulness experiences happiness in his body. This is how the noble
ones see it. He attains and abides in the third dhyāna, with equanimity and mindfulness,
abiding in happiness, without joy.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, having rid himself of happiness, and of suffering, and having
already put an end to positivity and negativity of mind, attains and abides in the fourth
dhyāna, free from suffering and happiness, and with completely pure equanimity and mindfulness.

In this way, he practices meditation, and does not abandon the concentrated, completely pure,
completely cleansed, unblemished state of meditative concentration where the secondary vices
are absent.

What, then, is the bodhisatva’s practice of meditation? It is the practice of superior abilities
and knowledge which he accomplishes.
